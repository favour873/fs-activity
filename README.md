# Flashswarm README

Flashswarm is a notification app that lets a team member choose the time of day they are available to work on a project. It then sends a notification to the rest of the team to see if anyone can join at that time if they are also free. Swarms are decided on the go, hence the name Flashswarm.

## Project Status

### Does the code work? If not, what's broken?
- **Landing Page:** Created without issues, with minor adjustments to the look.
- **Button Functionality:** The button to create a flashswarm doesn't work.

### How is the code better than what the team currently has?
- **Date/Time Picker:** The team previously had issues using the React version of the date/time picker. The code from ChatGPT uses React's datepicker without any issues.

### How is the code worse?
- **Button Functionality:** The button to create a flashswarm is non-functional.

### How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
- **Attempts:** A couple.
- **Main Struggles:** N/A

### Overall impression of the experience
- **Experience:** Never tried to make entire components with React before, only used it for bug fixes along the way. This was a good learning experience.

## Future Steps
- Fix the button functionality for creating a flashswarm.
- Continue refining the user interface for better user experience.
- Test the app with the team and gather feedback for further improvements.
