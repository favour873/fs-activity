- Does the code work? If not, what's broken.
    Created the landing page with no issues, I had to adjust the look a little bit but the button to 
create a flashswarm doesn't work.
- How is the code better than what the team currently has?
    I recall the team trying to use the react version of the date/time picker but it gave us some 
problems but the code from chatgpt uses react's datepicker with no issues.
- How is the code worse?
Button functionality.
- How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
    A couple.
- Overall impression of the experience
Never tried to make entire components with react, only used it for bugs 
along the way but this was a good learning experience.-
